        <p id="p0">GLOBAL GAME JAM 2015</p>
        
        <p id="p1">This year, between January 23-25 I participated in Global Game Jam - Istanbul @BUG It was a (mostly) pleasant experience, it had it&#39s moments. </p>
        
        <p id="p2">This is the first time that I’ve made a game from scratch. I used Construct 2. Construct 2 is a beautiful and a rather powerful 2D game engine which uses HTML5. There is no coding in it, only events, kinda like drag and drop game making tools. So it suited well for me.</p>
        
        <p id="p3">This year’s theme was “what do you do now?” so I decided to make a space game like faster than light. I was planning to use physical cards as the random event generator but I didn’t have enough time to do that. Game turned out to be a Battlestar Galactica spinoff with predefined events which occured on certain  star systems. Your aim was to find the “earth”. I didn’t want just one gameplay element. There was 3 different top down and one side scrolling  scenarios. </p>
        
        <p id="p4">Hardest part was the presenting the game to almost 100 people.</p>
        
        <p id="p5">Some notes:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Come prepared: Not for the game, but for the phsyical side of it. Bring your pillow or whatever you need to sleep on your own. Don’t rely on the jam site’s stuff. The place may be cold, or hot, you may never know, be prepared for both. Have food for the night, don’t drink energy drinks.</li>
            <li>Be social: My jam site had no competition, so i got that going for me, which is nice. That enabled a friendly –non competitive environment, you could just head over someone’s computer and ask what they’re doing. Those are possibly some cool people that you may learn something from.</li>
            <li>Take notes: Take notes, lots of notes. Always plan your game’s ever element, every mechanic, every asset you’re going to use.</li>
            <li>Install everything you need on your computer before the jam, you may not have a stable and fast internet connection at the jam site.</li>
            <li>Don’t stress out if you’re not going to be able to finish it, try to learn from your mistakes.</li>
            <li>Sleep at least few hours every night. Don’t stay hungry for more than few hours.</li>
            <li>Don’t play music from your speakers when there are people you don’t know. (people actually do that)</li>
            <li>Document your roadmap and changes, it will help you be organized.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p id="p6">That’s it. GGJ 2015 contributed too much to me, I’ve learned so many things and I’ll definitely participate next year too. Thank you for reading.</p>
